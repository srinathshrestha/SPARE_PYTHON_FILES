# Generate a random integer from a to b. You and your friend have to guess a number between two numbers a and b. a and b
# are inputs taken from the user. Your friend is player 1 and plays first. He will have to keep choosing the number and
# your program must tell whether the number is greater than the actual number or less than the actual number. Log the
# number of trials it took your friend to arrive at the number. You play the same game and then the person with minimum
# number of trials wins! Randomly generate a number after taking a and b as input and donâ€™t show that
# to the user.
